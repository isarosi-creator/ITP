For my final project I will be building a personal portfolio website using html. I will use the previous sources to help me with doing so. It will feature an overview of myself as an aspiring professional guitarist. 
This shouldnt greatly affect my other class work.
At a minimum I will have a working website featuring a picture of me and my body of work experience
A better outcome would be to have a website with multiple sections and is formatted nicely and looks good
Best outcome will be all of that as well as videos of me playing present.
This weekend I will make the outline of the website and have a rough draft with minimum of what i want completed
By next weekend I will have my picture and experience up hope to have the seperate sections done as well
By the weekend after i will hope to have the videos of me playing and have the project fully complete
